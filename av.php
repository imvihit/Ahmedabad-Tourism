    <strong>Adalaj Stepwell</strong>(Gujarati:&#2693;&#2721;&#2750;&#2738;&#2716;&#2309;&#2337;&#2366;&#2354;&#2332;) is a unique Hindu 'water building' in the village of Adalaj, close to Ahmedabad town in Gandhinagar district in the Indian state of Gujarat. The stepwell was   built in 1499 by Muslim king Mohammed Begda for Queen Rani Roopba, wife of Veer   Singh, the Vaghela chieftain. The step well or   'Vav', as it is called in Gujarati, is intricately carved and is five   stories in depth. Such step wells were once integral to the semi arid regions of   Gujarat as they provided basic water needs for drinking, washing and bathing.   These wells were also venues for colorful festivals and sacred rituals.
    <p>Stepwells, also called stepped   ponds, built between the 5th and 19th centuries, are common in the west of India; over 120 such wells are reported in the semi-arid   region of Gujarat alone, of which the well at Adalaj is most popular. Stepwells are also found in more arid regions of the   subcontinent, extending into Pakistan, to collect   rain water during seasonal monsoons. While many such structures are utilitarian   in construction, they sometimes include significant architectural   embellishments, as in the Adlaj stepwell, which attracts a large number of   tourists. In the past, these stepwells were frequented by travelers and caravans   as stopovers along trade routes</p>

    <h2><span id="Etymology">Etymology</span></h2>
    <p>While in Gujarati and Marwari language, the stepwell is called a <em>vav</em>, (leading down to the level of water), in other Hindi-speaking   regions of North India it is known as a <em>baoli</em> (also spelt,   &lsquo;bawdi&rsquo;, &lsquo;bawri&rsquo; and &lsquo;bavadi&rsquo;).<a href="#cite_note-define-5"></a></p>
    <h2><span id="History">History</span></h2>
    <p>A research scholar, who studied the history and architecture of the stepwells   in Gujarat under a Fulbright Fellowship, has termed these   wells as &ldquo;High Hindu Stepwells&rdquo; because of the recorded literature of the Brahmins of the period from fifth to   ninth centuries, during the &ldquo;High Hindu period&rdquo;. While the Brahmins were the architects, the   builders were artisans of Sompara sect of low&ndash;caste Hindus. A wide unbridgable gulf of   religious distinction existed between the two groups, with the former getting   all the credit</p>
    <p>Before the history of Adalaj Stepwell is stated, it would be informative to   mention that the first rock-cut step wells in India are dated from 200 AD to 400   AD. Subsequently, the wells at Dhank (550-625) and construction of stepped ponds   at Bhinmal (850-950) took place.<a href="#cite_note-7"></a></p>
    <p>The city of Mohenjo-daro has wells, which   may be the predecessor of the step well; as many as 700 wells have been   discovered in just one section of the city leading scholars to believe that   'cylindrical brick lined wells' were invented by the people of the Indus Valley Civilization.Between third and   second millineum BC, at the 'Great Bath', at the site of Mohenjodaro of the Harappan civilization, filling of water   was achieved from a large well located in one of the rooms in front of the open   courtyard of the building&ndash;complex.<a href="#cite_note-hooja-9"></a></p>
    <p>While early stepwells were made of stone, later step wells were made of   mortar, stucco, rubble and laminar stones. The well cylinder was the basic form   used to deepen the wells. It is also inferred that the Stepwells in Gujarat have   survived so long in view of the builder&rsquo;s knowledge of the soil conditions and   the earthquake proneness of the region.<a href="#cite_note-10"></a></p>
    <p>The well size recommended, based on considerations of stability, was of four   to thirteen <em>hasta</em> (&lsquo;hasta&rsquo; a Sanskrit word, which means &ldquo;forearm&rdquo; of size   varying from 12&ndash;24 inches (300&ndash;610 mm)), A size of eight <em>hasta</em> was   considered ideal and a 13 <em>hasta</em> well was considered dangerous. However,   the well thickness from top to bottom remained generally uniform.<a href="#cite_note-11"></a> By the 11th   century, the step well planning and design acquired architectural excellence and   the Hindu Stepwells were standardized.<a href="#cite_note-12"></a></p>
    <p>The history of the Adalaj step-well built in 1498 is established by an   inscription in Sanskrit found on a marble slab positioned in a recess on the   first floor, from the eastern entry to the well. Its construction was started by   Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty of   Dandai Desh. But he was killed in a war, wherefater the Muslim king Mohammed   Begda of a neighbouring state built it in Indo-Islamic architectural style, in   1499.</p>
    <p>The cultural and architectural depiction in the deep wells at various levels   are a tribute to the history of step wells, built initially by Hindus and   subsequently ornamented and blended with Islamic architecture during the Muslim rule.<a href="#cite_note-detail-2"></a></p>
    <h2><span id="Legend">Legend</span></h2>
    <p>There is an interesting legend related to the building of this stepwell. In   the 15th century, Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty, a Hindu ruler, reigned over this territory, then known as Dandai Desh.   His kingdom was attacked by Mohammed Begda, the Muslim ruler of a neighboring   kingdom. The battle resulted in the Rana king getting killed. Consequently his   territory was occupied by the invader. Rana Veer Singh&rsquo;s widow, a beautiful lady   known by the name Rani Roopba, though in deep grief at the death of her husband,   agreed to a marriage proposal made by Mohammed Begda on the condition that he   would first complete the building of the stepwell. The Muslim king who was   deeply enamoured of the queen&rsquo;s beauty agreed to the proposal and then built the   well in quick time, and with great interest. Once the well was completed, Begda   reminded the queen of her promise to marry him. But the queen who had achieved   her ambition of completing the stepwell started by her husband, decided to end   her life, as mark of devotion to her husband. She circumambulated the stepwell with prayers to   God and jumped into the well, thus ending the saga of building the well in   tragedy.</p>
    <p>The chronology of events that resulted in building of the stepwell is also   depicted on the walls of the well. There was no remorseful reaction by Begda as   he allowed the well to remain without any defacing.<a href="#cite_note-culture-3"></a></p>
    <p>Another legend narrated is linked to the tombs found near the well. The tombs   of six masons who built the well are seen near the <em>Vav</em>. It is said that   the Begda asked the Masons if they could build another similar well. But a   positive answer from them resulted in a further tragedy as Begda put them to   death. Begda was so enamoured of the architectural excellence of the stepwell   that he did not want its replica to be built.<a href="#cite_note-culture-3"></a></p>

    </div>
    <p>Built in sand stone in Indo-Islamic architectural style, the Adlaj stepwell   is five stories deep. It is octagonal (8-sided polygon) in plan at the top,   built on intricately carved large number of pillars. Each floor is spacious   enough to provide for people to congregate. It was dug   deep to access ground water at that level, accounting for seasonal fluctuations   in water level due to rainfall over the year. The air and light vents in the   roofs at various floors and at the landing level are in the form of large   openings. From the first story level, three staircases lead to the bottom water   level of the well, which is considered a unique feature. Built along a   North-South axis, entrance is from the South, the three staircases are from the   South, West and East directions leading to the landing, which is on the northern   side of the well. Four small rooms with oriel windows decorated with minutely carved   brackets are provided at the landing level, at the four corners. The structural   system is typically Indian style with traditional trabeat with horizontal beams and   lintels. At the bottom of the well is a square stepped floor in the shape of a   funnel extending to the lowest plane. This is chiseled into a circular well.   Above the square floor, columns, beams, wall and arched openings spiral around;   a feature that continues to the top. The top part of the well, however, is a   vertical space open to the sky. The four corners of the square are strengthened   with stone beams, set at 45 degrees angle. The motifs of   flowers and graphics of Islamic architecture blend very well with the symbols of   Hindu and Jain gods carved   at various levels of the well. The dominant carvings on the upper floors are of   elephants (3&nbsp;inches (76&nbsp;mm) in size, each of different design). The Islamic   architectural style could be attributed to the Muslim king Begda who built it.   The walls are carved with women performing daily chores such as churning of   buttermilk, adorning themselves, scenes of performance of dancers and musicians,   and the King overlooking all these activities.</p>

            Intricate carving in the well   structure</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>An interesting depiction carved from a single block of stone is of the <em>Ami   Khumbor</em> (symbolic pot of the water of life) and the <em>Kalp Vriksha</em> (a   tree of life). Also seen is a fresco of navagraha or nine planets. These depictions are said to attract villagers for worship   during marriage and other ritualistic ceremonies.</p>
    <p>It has been implied that the temperature inside the well is about five   degrees lower than the outside hot summer temperatures. It is one of the reasons   for the ladies who came to fetch water from the well spending considerable time   in the cool climes here. They not only collect water but also worship the gods   and goddesses depicted at various levels and while away time in good   chatter.</p>
    <p>A tribute paid to the rich underground structures, which are intricately   decorated with sculptures, is that they are said to resemble palaces.<a href="#cite_note-define-5"></a></p>
