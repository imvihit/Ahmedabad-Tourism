<p><strong>Sabarmati Ashram</strong> (Gujarati: &#2744;&#2750;&#2732;&#2736;&#2734;&#2724;&#2752;   &#2694;&#2742;&#2765;&#2736;&#2734; also known as Gandhi Ashram, Harijan Ashram,Satyagraha Ashram) is located in the   Ahmedabad suburb of Sabarmati adjoining to famous Ashram Road, at the bank of River Sabarmati, 4   miles from the town hall. This was one of the residences of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. This   ashram is now a national monument by the Government of India due to its   significance in the Indian independence movement in the form of the Dandi March in 1930.</p>

<h2><span id="History">History</span></h2>
<p>The ashram was originally established at the Kocharab Bungalow of Jivanlal   Desai on 25 May 1915. The Ashram was then shifted on 17 June 1917 to a piece of   open land on the banks of the river Sabarmati. Reasons for this shift included:   Gandhi wanted to do some experiments in living (e.g. farming, animal husbandry, cow breeding, khadi and related   constructive activities for which he was in search of this kind of barren land.)   It was believed that this was ancient ashram site of Dadhichi   Rishi who had donated his bones for a righteous war, but his actual ashram   lies in Naimisharanya, near Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh; it is between a jail and a   crematorium, and he believed that a satyagrahi has invariably to go to either place. Mahatma   Gandhi said, &quot;This is the right place for our activities to carry on the   search for truth and develop fearlessness, for on one   side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of   Mother Nature.&quot;</p>
<p>While at the Ashram, Gandhi formed a tertiary school that mainly focused on   manual labour, agriculture, and literacy to advance his efforts for nation's   self-sufficiency. It was also from here on the 12 March 1930 that Gandhi marched   towards Dandi, 241 miles from the Ashram with 78 companions in protest of the British Salt Law,   which taxed Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India.   This mass awakening filled the British jails with 60,000 freedom fighters. Later   the government seized their property, Gandhi, in sympathy with them, responded   by asking the Government to forfeit the Ashram. Then Government, however, did   not oblige. He had by now already decided on 22 July 1933 to disband the Ashram,   which later became asserted place after the detention of many freedom fighters,   and then some local citizens decided to preserve it. On 12 March 1930 he vowed   that he would not return to the Ashram until India won independence. Although   this was won on 15 August 1947, when India was declared a free nation, Gandhi   was assassinated in January 1948.</p>

<p>The ashram now has a museum, Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalay. In 1963 the museum   building was erected (designed by architect Charles Correa), and memorial activities were   then started here.One of the important activities undertaken is the   establishment of a Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya. Initially started in 'Hriday   Kunj,' Gandhi's own cottage in the Ashram, the Sangrahalaya has now shifted to   its own well-designed and well-furnished building which was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, on 10 May   1963.</p>
<p>Nandini: It is on the right hand side of 'Hridaya Kunj'. It is an old Ashram   guest house, where guests from India and abroad are put up.</p>
<p>Vinoba Kutir: Named after Acharya Vinoba Bhave who stayed here, and also   known as Mira Kutir after Miraben, Gandhiji's disciple, daughter of a British   Admiral.</p>
<p>Upasana Mandir:It is an open -air prayer ground, situated between 'Hridaya   Kunj' and 'Magan Kutir' (the hut where Maganlal Gandhi, the ashram manager, used   to stay).Here, Gandhiji used to refer to individual questions after prayers and   as the head of the family analysed and gave his solutions.</p>
