                                  <p>Located off the Sarkhej Gandhinagar Highway, Science City is an ambitious initiative of the government of Gujarat to trigger an inquiry of science in the mind of a common citizen with the aid of entertainment and experiential knowledge. Covering an area of more than 107 hectares, the idea is to create imaginative exhibits, virtual reality activity corners, and live demonstrations in an easily understandable manner.&nbsp;<br />
                                      <br />
                                    Currently the 3D Imax theater, musical dancing fountain, energy park and simulation rides interest visitors. It is hoped that as this place develops, the investment helps to create awareness and sensitivity to better care for our ecology and people through the appropriate use of science and technology. The park is open from 12-9pm. For more information see&nbsp;<a title="http://www.scity.org" target="_blank" href="http://www.scity.org/">Science City</a>&nbsp;or call 079-65220111<br />
